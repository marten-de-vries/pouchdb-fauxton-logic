This repository contains the JavaScript that's added to
[pouchdb-fauxton-base](https://github.com/marten-de-vries/pouchdb-fauxton-base)
to make a working version of Fauxton running on top of PouchDB.

It does that by injecting a mock XHR object in the Fauxton page, which
converts all requests made by Fauxton into
[CouchDB request objects](http://docs.couchdb.org/en/latest/json-structure.html#request-object).
These are then converted to PouchDB method calls by
[pouchdb-route](https://www.npmjs.org/package/pouchdb-route). The result
is a [CouchDB response object](http://docs.couchdb.org/en/latest/json-structure.html#response-object),
which is returned by the mock xhr object as the response to the request.
